**Echo**

1. 助记,

   echo, 扣一下桌子听回音.

2. 词源

   **Origin**

   Middle English: from Old French or Latin, from Greek ēkhō, related to ēkhē ‘a sound’.

    **echo (n.)**

   mid-14c., "**sound repeated by reflection**," from Latin **echo,** from Greek echo, personified in classical mythology as a mountain nymph who pined away for love of Narcissus until nothing was left of her but her voice, from or related to ekhe "sound," ekhein "to resound," from PIE *wagh-io-, extended form of root *(s)wagh- "to resound" (source also of Sanskrit vagnuh "sound," Latin vagire "to cry," Old English swogan "to resound"). Related: Echoes. Echo chamber attested from 1937.

   **echo** 借自拉丁语，但源出希腊神话传说。在古希腊神话中 **Echo** 是居于山林水泽的仙女。据古罗马诗人奥维德( **Ovid** ，43 **BC **—17 **AD** )的长诗《变形记》， **Echo** 曾做过天后赫拉( **Hera** )的使女。当赫拉的丈夫主神宙斯( **Zeus** )和情人幽会时， **Echo**故意缠住好妒的赫拉，不停地同她讲话，转移她的注意力，使她不能继续监视丈夫。后来赫拉发现上当，又气又恨，就使 **Echo** 失去独立说话的能力，而只能重复别人谈话的尾音。之后，可怜的 **Echo** 在林中遇见了美少年那喀索斯( **Narcissus** )，爱上了他，但遭到了拒绝。从此终日抑郁，形容日见枯槁，以至最后在山林中只留下她叹息的声音。现在每当我们在山间高喊，就能听到回声，仿佛是 **Echo** 在应答似的。另据希腊作家朗戈斯（ **Longus** ，创作时期2 **-** 3世纪）的说法， **Echo** 拒绝了畜牧神潘( **Pan** )的求爱，潘怀恨在心，使一群牧人发疯，把她撕成碎片。大地女神盖亚( **Gaea** )掩埋了她的尸体，只让她的回声留在人间。因此， **Echo **一词进入了英语之后，就被赋予了“回声”、“反响”等义。

Replaced native [other](https://www.etymonline.com/word/other?ref=etymonline_crossreference) in this sense because of the ambiguity of the earlier word. Second sight is from 1610s; an etymologically perverse term, because it means in reality the sight of events before, not after, they occur. Second fiddle first attested 1809:

   1) 路由器 a piece of electronic equipment that connectscomputer networks to each other, and sends information betweennetworks 

   A device which forwards data packets to the appropriate parts of a computer network.

   A **router**[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)#cite_note-2) is a [networking device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_device) that forwards [data packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_packet) between [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). A data packet is typically [forwarded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_forwarding) from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an [internetwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork) until it reaches its destination [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)#cite_note-3)

   A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks.[[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)#cite_note-4) When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the [network address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address) information in the packet to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its [routing table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table) or [routing policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_policy), it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.

   The most familiar type of routers are [home and small office routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_router) that simply forward [IP packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_packet) between the home computers and the Internet. An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which connects to the Internet through an [Internet service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) (ISP). More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful [core routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_router) that forward data at high speed along the [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber) lines of the [Internet backbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone). Though routers are typically **dedicated** hardware devices, software-based routers also exist.

       *fatal (adj.)*

       late 14c., "decreed by fate," also "fraught with fate," from Middle French fatal (14c.) and directly from Latin fatalis "ordained by fate, decreed, destined; destructive, deadly," from fatum (see [fate](https://www.etymonline.com/word/fate?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.)); sense of "causing or attended with death" in English is from early 15c.

**Culprit** /ˈkʌl.prɪt/

1. 助记,

2. 词源,

   **Origin**

   Late 17th century (originally in the formula Culprit, how will you be tried?, said by the Clerk of the Crown to a prisoner pleading not guilty): perhaps from a misinterpretation of the written abbreviation cul. prist for Anglo-Norman French Culpable: prest d'averrer notre bille ‘(You are) guilty: (We are) ready to prove our indictment’; in later use influenced by Latin culpa ‘fault, blame’.

   *culprit (n.)*

   1670s, from Anglo-French cul prit, contraction of Culpable: prest (d'averrer nostre bille) "guilty, ready (to prove our case)," words used by prosecutor in opening a trial. It seems the abbreviation cul. prit was mistaken in English for an address to the defendant.

1. 定义

n.一片混乱；闹哄哄的场所

1. 词源

667, Pandæmonium, in "Paradise Lost" the name of the palace built in the middle of Hell, "the high capital of Satan and all his peers," coined by John Milton (1608-1674) from Greek pan- "all" (see [pan-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pan-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + Late Latin daemonium "evil spirit," from Greek daimonion "inferior divine power," from daimon "lesser god" (see [demon](https://www.etymonline.com/word/demon?ref=etymonline_crossreference)).

Transferred sense "place of uproar" is from 1779; that of "wild, lawless confusion" is from 1865. Related: Pandemoniac; pandemoniacal; pandemonian; pandemonic.

1. 相关词

demon (n.)

c. 1200, from Latin daemon "spirit," from Greek daimon "deity, divine power; lesser god; guiding spirit, tutelary deity" (sometimes including souls of the dead); "one's genius, lot, or fortune;" from PIE *dai-mon- "divider, provider" (of fortunes or destinies), from root [*da-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*da-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to divide."Used (with daimonion) in Christian Greek translations and Vulgate for "god of the heathen" and "unclean spirit." Jewish authors earlier had employed the Greek word in this sense, using it to render shedim "lords, idols" in the Septuagint, and Matthew viii.31 has daimones, translated as deofol in Old English, feend or deuil in Middle English. Another Old English word for this was hellcniht, literally "hell-knight."The original mythological sense is sometimes written daemon for purposes of distinction. The Demon of Socrates was a daimonion, a "divine principle or inward oracle." His accusers, and later the Church Fathers, however, represented this otherwise. The Demon Star (1895) is [Algol](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Algol?ref=etymonline_crossreference).

   1530s, "result, outcome," from Latin successus "an advance, a coming up; a good result, happy outcome," noun use of past participle of succedere "come after, follow after; go near to; come under; take the place of," also "go from under, mount up, ascend," hence "get on well, prosper, be victorious," from sub "next to, after" (see sub-) + cedere "go, move" (from PIE root *ked- "to go, yield"). Meaning "accomplishment of desired end" (good success) first recorded 1580s. Meaning "a thing or person which succeeds," especially in public, is from 1882.

   The moral flabbiness born of the bitch-goddess SUCCESS. That -- with the squalid interpretation put on the word success -- is our national disease. [William James to H.G. Wells, Sept. 11, 1906]

   Success story is attested from 1902. Among the French phrases reported by OED as in use in English late 19c. were succès d'estime "cordial reception given to a literary work out of respect rather than admiration" and succès de scandale "success (especially of a work of art) dependent upon its scandalous character."

   first person singular present **indicative of [be](https://www.etymonline.com/word/be?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (q.v.);** Old English eom bMercian eam, Northumbrian am), from Proto-Germanic *izm(i)-, from PIE *esmi- (source also of Old Norse emi, Gothic im, Hittite esmi, Old Church Slavonic jesmi, Lithuanian esmi), first person singular form of root [*es-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*es-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to be."In Old English it formed only present tenses, all other forms being expressed in the W-BASE (see [were](https://www.etymonline.com/word/were?ref=etymonline_crossreference), [was](https://www.etymonline.com/word/was?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). This cooperative verb is sometimes referred to by linguists as *es-*wes-. Until the distinction broke down 13c., *es-*wes- tended to express "existence," with beon meaning something closer to "come to be."Old English am had two plural forms: 1. sind/sindon, sie and 2. earon/aron. The s- form (also used in the subjunctive) fell from English in the early 13c. (though its cousin continues in German sind, the 3rd person plural of "to be") and was replaced by forms of be, but aron (see [are](https://www.etymonline.com/word/are?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) continued, and as am and be merged it encroached on some uses that previously had belonged to be. By the early 1500s it had established its place in standard English.

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Middle English: from Old Frech compas (noun), compasser (verb), based on Latin com- ‘together’ + passus ‘a step or pace’. Several senses (‘measure’, ‘artifice’, ‘circumscribed area’, and ‘pair of compasses’) which appeared in Middle English are also found in Old French, but their development and origin are uncertain. The transference of sense to the magnetic compass is held to have occurred in the related Italian word compasso, from the circular shape of the compass box.

   **Etymology**

   c. 1300, "space, area, extent, circumference," from Old French compas "circle, radius; size, extent; pair of compasses" (12c.), from compasser "to go around, measure (with a compass); divide equally," from Vulgar Latin *compassare "to pace out," from Latin com "with, together" (see [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + passus "a step" (from PIE root [*pete-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*pete-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to spread").The mathematical instrument for describing circles was so called in English from mid-14c. The mariners' directional tool (so called since early 15c.) took the name, perhaps, because it's round and has a point like the mathematical instrument.Meaning "limits, boundary" is from 1550s. Sense of "range of notes which a given voice or instrument can produce" is from 1590s. The word is in most European languages, with a mathematical sense in Romance, a nautical sense in Germanic, and both in English. In Middle English it also could mean "ingenuity, subtlety, cunning." Also an adverb in Middle English: to go compass was "go in a circle, go around."

   [Parameter - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter)

   **Computer programming**

   In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), two notions of [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)) are commonly used, and are referred to as [parameters and arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments)—or more formally as a **formal parameter** and an **actual parameter**.

   For example, in the definition of a function such as

   `y = f(x) = x + 2,`


   *x* is the *formal parameter* (the *parameter*) of the defined function.

   When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in

   `f(3): or, y = f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,`


    is the *actual parameter* (the *argument*) for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the *formal parameter* of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms *parameter* and *argument* might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)

   These concepts are discussed in a more precise way in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and its foundational disciplines, [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) and [combinatory logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic). Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) define parameter and argument as given here, while [Eiffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)) uses an [alternative convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Alternative_convention_in_Eiffel).

   In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.

   > [Parameter (computer programming) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments)
   >
   > Parameters appear in procedure definitions; arguments appear in procedure calls. In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. **Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.**

    **Mathematical functions[[edit source](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=1)]**

   [Mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_function) have one or more [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function) that are designated in the definition by [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)). A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general [quadratic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function) by declaring


   here, the variable *x* designates the function's argument, but *a*, *b*, and *c* are parameters that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-*b* logarithm by the formula
